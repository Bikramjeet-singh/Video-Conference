Zoomly is a video calling based completely on node.js. In order to setup the server I've used "xirsys" as a foreign client.
concept of WebRTC is used and Socket.io is used for data transfer.



Zoomly provides features like:-

1.Screen Share.

2.Screen Record.

3.Chat with the attendees.

4.Logout.




To run the file:-

1.Just clone the code.

2.Make your account on "xirsys" and update the credentials in the settings.py file.

3.npm install to install the dependencies.

4.Go in the src folder and run the "app.js".
